# Smart Contract–Based Waste Management

## 📌 Project Description
This project demonstrates a blockchain-based waste management system using a Solidity smart contract.  
It allows users to register waste items, track their collection status, and ensure transparency and authenticity of the waste disposal process through a decentralized ledger.

## 🎯 Project Vision
To build a transparent, tamper-proof, and decentralized waste tracking and management platform that promotes environmental responsibility and encourages verified waste collection.

## 🔑 Key Features
- **Waste Registration**: Users can register different types of waste on-chain.
- **Collection Tracking**: Collectors can mark waste as collected, creating a trustworthy audit trail.
- **Immutable Records**: All interactions are stored on the blockchain, preventing manipulation.
- **Public Accessibility**: Anyone can view registered waste details for inspection and monitoring.

## 🚀 Future Scope
- Integration with an ERC-20 reward token for waste collectors.  
- Mobile dApp integration for real-time waste pickup tracking.  
- Geo-tagging waste locations on decentralized storage.  
- AI-based waste classification using image uploads.  
- DAO governance for community-driven waste management.
